Sudoku solver is a challenge given at Dev Bootcamp at the Friday of the first week. Groups of 4-5 try, but at that time are usually too green to try it.

Take in a string of 81 chars that represent a sudoku board.

Return a solved board.

Show's how much coding practices can improve over time. The first time I attempted this, it took 2 days and 4 people to return a solution that worked for some sudoku puzzles.  I went back as a recently graduated alum, and spent 3 hours developing a solution that could solve all 15 puzzles.
